Selenium Grid Setup for Windows Servers
-----------------------------------------
trying to make a standalone selenium grid distro that works even better 
than what I have put together before. Fuck visgrid and its GUI i could make
a better one blind folded. It doesnt take into account idle timeout and 
it eventually auto closes browsers. 

SO i downloaded the raw selenium server and setup my own config.json file.

should be ready to run with the start.bat.
